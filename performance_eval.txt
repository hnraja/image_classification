* The most accurate model used leaky_relu and nadam.
* Had accuracy of 73.36%
* Had loss 0.8493 and took 195s to fit

* In general, the best performing models used RELU activation functions
  (relu, leaky_relu, relu6) along with ADAM optimizers (adam, nadam, adamw).
* These models had accuracies of 71%-74% and losses in the range 0.84-0.9.
* Most of these models also had reasonable fit times in range 175-195 s.
* The exceptions, (relu, nadam) and (leaky_relu, adamw) took 2409s and 302s, respectively.
