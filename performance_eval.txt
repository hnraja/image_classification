In terms of accuracy
* The best model is (leaky_relu, nadam), which has an accuracy of 72.93%.
* This is the model saved in "model.keras"
* The best performing models generally use RELU activation
  functions (leaky_relu, relu6, relu)
* Exponential, sigmoid and softmax generally perform the worst.
* The best performing optimizers are the ADAM functions (adam, adamw, nadam)
* ftrl and adadelta have the worst performance.

In terms of loss
* The best model (relu, nadam) has a loss of 0.855.
* Other than the extreme combination (adagrad, exponential) with loss 4818, the loss
  is less than 2.4.
* Once again, RELU activations with ADAM optimizers perform the best.

In terms of time
* Other than the extreme combination (tanh, adamw) with run time 3067s, the run time
  is general in the range 152-304s
* The trends are less clear; generally, relu runs faster than other activations
* Generally, SGD runs faster than other optimizers.

* Overall, the (relu, nadam) model, with
    * accuracy: 71.59% (rank 6/99)
    * loss: 0.855340   (rank 1/99)
    * run time: 162s   (rank 6/99)
  and the (leaky_relu, nadam) model, with
    * accuracy: 72.93% (rank 1/99)
    * loss: 0.877800   (rank 5/99)
    * run time: 179s   (rank 65/99)
